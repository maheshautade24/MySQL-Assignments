1. What is SQL?

Answer:-
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform operations like querying, updating, and deleting data, and creating and modifying database structures.


2. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?

Answer:-
DELETE: Deletes specific rows based on a condition and can be rolled back.
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, resets auto-increment values, and cannot be rolled back.
DROP: Deletes the entire table, including its structure.


3. What is the purpose of the WHERE clause?

Answer:-
The WHERE clause filters records in a query based on specified conditions, returning only matching rows.


4. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?

Answer:-
INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching data in both tables.
OUTER JOIN: Includes unmatched rows in addition to matched rows (LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER).


5. What does the COUNT() function do?

Answer:-
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows in a table or matching a specific condition.



6. What is the use of GROUP BY?

Answer:-
GROUP BY groups rows sharing a value in a specified column and applies aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, etc., on each group.



7. What does the HAVING clause do?

Answer:-
The HAVING clause filters groups after the GROUP BY operation based on conditions.



8. What is the use of MIN() and AVG() functions?

Answer:-
MIN(): Returns the smallest value in a column.
AVG(): Calculates the average value of a numeric column.



9. What is a subquery?

Answer:-
A subquery is a query within another query. It provides intermediate results to the main query.



10. What is a UNION operator?

Answer:-
The UNION operator combines results from two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicates.



11. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

Answer:-
UNION: Combines results from multiple queries and removes duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combines results without removing duplicates.



12. What is a CASE statement in SQL?

Answer:-
A CASE statement provides conditional logic in SQL queries, similar to an "if-else" construct.



13. What are SQL constraints?

Answer:-
SQL constraints are rules enforced on table columns to maintain data integrity. Examples include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK.



14. What is the difference between PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY?

Answer:-
PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
FOREIGN KEY: Establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key in another table.



15. What is a unique constraint?

Answer:-
A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct.



16. What is a foreign key in SQL?

Answer:-
A FOREIGN KEY is a column or combination of columns that establishes a link between data in two tables by referencing a PRIMARY KEY in another table.



17. What is the purpose of the ALL keyword in SQL?

Answer:-
The ALL keyword compares a value against all values returned by a subquery.



18. What is the purpose of the ANY keyword in SQL?

Answer:-
The ANY keyword compares a value against any value in a list or subquery.
